""" wingdbstub.py -- Start debugging Python programs from outside of Wing

Copyright (c) 1999-2018, Archaeopteryx Software, Inc.  All rights reserved.

Written by Stephan R.A. Deibel and John P. Ehresman

Usage:
-----

This file is used to initiate debug in Python code without launching
that code from Wing.  To use it, edit the configuration values below,
start Wing and configure it to listen for outside debug connections,
and then add the following line to your code:

  import wingdbstub

Debugging will start immediately after this import statement is reached.

For details, see Debugging Externally Launched Code in the manual.

# This is only used when the debug process is not attached to
# an IDE or the IDE has dropped its connection. The configured
# port can optionally be added to the IDE's Common Attach Hosts
# preference. Note that a random port is used instead if the given 
# port is already in use.

# internals to a file.  If the file does not exist, it will be created
# as long as its enclosing directory exists and is writeable.  Use

# "<stderr>" may cause problems on Windows if the debug process is not 
# running in a console.

# creates and reuses a Python instance across multiple script invocations.  
# It turns off automatic detection of program quit so that the debug session
# can span multiple script invocations.  When this is turned on, you may
# need to call ProgramQuit() on the debugger object to shut down the
# debugger cleanly when your application exits or discards the Python
# instance.  If multiple Python instances are created in the same run,
# only the first one will be able to debug unless it terminates debug
# and the environment variable WINGDB_ACTIVE is unset before importing
# this module in the second or later Python instance.  See the Wing
# manual for details.
